# (which can be used in conjunction with gnokii/smsd and others) or through 
# a watched directory.

# Once you have selected a server you need to register the appropriate handlers
# By example a PingHandler and ILoveYouHandler are registered. Handlers are
# ordered, when processing a message the server will give each handler an
# opportunity to handle it in order (unless a handler issues a halt). If you 
# assign handlers to the processor, it will register the handlers with all
# available servers. If you want more fine-grained control, register the 
# handlers on the server instance itself.
