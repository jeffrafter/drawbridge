== Knight Foundation RSS And News on Cell Phones (RANC) by DataDyne

Gateway and message handler for management of incoming and outgoing 
messages to proxy to the server. This will also act as the cache for user 
sessions.

There are more than 3 Billion mobile phone subscribers in the world (2008) and
many, if not all have access to a simple stateless prototol called SMS. Only
1.5 Billion people have used the Internet (2008) meaning that there is a large
population which is connected but cannot use the Internet. Bridging the gap
with SMS will make available vast functionality and services that were 
previously not usable.

This project is composed of a simple gateway (proxy) that feeds commands to 
a remote server for translation and management.

facilitate this, you need the following gems:

  toholio-serialport
  jeffrafter-rubygsm
  jeffrafter-lokii
  daemons
  
To communicate with the server you will need some communications gems:

  jnunemaker-httparty
  jeffrafter-resource_party
  
For testing you will need:

  thoughtbot-factory_girl
  thoughtbot-shoulda
  mocha
  fakeweb
  
For data you will need

  active_record
