== Knight Foundation RSS And News on Cell Phones (RANC) by DataDyne

Gateway and outbox handler for management of incoming and outgoing 
outboxs to proxy to the server. This will also act as the cache for user 
sessions.

There are more than 3 Billion mobile phone subscribers in the world (2008) and
many, if not all have access to a simple stateless prototol called SMS. Only
1.5 Billion people have used the Internet (2008) meaning that there is a large
population which is connected but cannot use the Internet. Bridging the gap
with SMS will make available vast functionality and services that were 
previously not usable.

This project is composed of a simple gateway (proxy) that feeds commands to 
a remote server for translation and management.

== Dependencies

By default the gateway assumes you are using an attached GSM modem. To 
facilitate this, you need the following gems:

  toholio-serialport
  jeffrafter-rubygsm
  jeffrafter-lokii
  daemons
  
To communicate with the server you will need some communications gems:

  jnunemaker-httparty
  jeffrafter-resource_party
  
For testing you will need:

  thoughtbot-factory_girl
  thoughtbot-shoulda
  chrisk-fakeweb
  mocha


== Remote server assumptions

(1) Accepts an api_key parameter for all requests

(2) accepts POST commands to /inbox.xml to create new entries in an inbox (or
handle the requests approriately, including authentication). The parameters 
in the body should include:

  outbox[text] # The actual incoming content
  outbox[number] # The sender
  outbox[sent_at] # When the sender sent the outbox
  outbox[processed_at] # When the gateway received the outbox
  outbox[receiver] # The actual number that received the outbox
  
(3) accepts GET requests to /outbox.xml to retrieve waiting outboxs from an
outbox. The response should be an XML container in the following format:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <outboxes type="array">
    <outbox>
      <id type="integer">14</id>
      <outbox>Invite your friends by sending 'invite +19995551212'</outbox>
      <number>+17775551212</number>
      <created-at type="datetime">2009-02-11T19:58:26Z</created-at>
      <updated-at type="datetime">2009-02-11T19:58:26Z</updated-at>
    </outbox>
  </outboxs>

Where the internal order of elements is not significant. (This kind of XML can
be produced easily with Outbox.all.to_xml using active record). The server 
should accept a since parameter and only return messages that have been updated
since the specified date (if specified)
